# MultiSignWallets
Multisignwallet is a contract in which we do basic transcation but with a twist , in which we have certain 
people who will approve the transaction and if the no of approval is greater than the specific no. then the
transcation is approved. 
Here we create a mapping in which we see store owner's addresses . 
The transcation is approved by owners and if the count of approvals passes a certain limit then the transaction is executed .
